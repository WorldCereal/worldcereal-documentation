### Download Official Products

This section allows users to download official products for their area of interest. Currently, official products are only available for the "2021" collection.

</p>

#### Step 1: Select Collection and Product
Select the desired collection and product, then proceed to the next step.

</p>

#### Step 2: Define Area of Interest and Output Format
Specify the area of interest (AOI) and output format, then create a new download process. Users can return to the previous step to modify their selection if needed. The download job will not start until it is confirmed in the next step.

*Note: There is a limit to the size of the area that can be selected. Current limits are displayed above the map window, and the size of the selected area is shown below the map window.*

</p>

#### Step 3: Confirm and Start the Process
Review the details of the process. If everything is correct, start the process. Once created, the user will be redirected to the "Your Processes" page. Additional processes can also be created and run later from the "Your Processes" tab.

</p>

#### Step 1: Select Product Type and Model
Select the desired product type and model, then proceed to the next step.

*Note: Currently, only the "Default" model and "Cropland" product are available.*

</p>

#### Step 2: Define Parameters
Specify the area of interest (AOI), end month, and output format, then create a new custom product process. Users can return to the previous step to modify their selection if needed. The custom product process will not start until it is confirmed in the next step.

*Note: There is a limit to the size of the area that can be selected. Current limits are displayed above the map window, and the size of the selected area is shown below the map window. Additionally, examples are provided to indicate the estimated processing time and credit consumption for different AOI sizes.*

</p>

#### Step 3: Confirm and Start the Process
Review the details of the process. If everything is correct, start the process. Once created, the user will be redirected to the "Your Processes" page. Additional processes can also be created and run later from the "Your Processes" tab.
