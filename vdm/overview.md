# Introduction

The Visualization and Dissemination Module (VDM) represents the gateway to access the WorldCereal processing system and the global products generated by the consortium. 

Currently, its main task is to provide the user with the ability to visualize and explore the [global products for 2021](https://esa-worldcereal.org/en/products/global-maps), generated at the end of the first phase of the project (2023).

[Discover here](./visualize.md) the different viewing capabilities of the module.

A set of [new user interfaces](./launch.md) will be added to the VDM, granting easy and user-friendly access to WorldCereal processing tools:
-	WorldCereal product download for a custom AOI via openEO
