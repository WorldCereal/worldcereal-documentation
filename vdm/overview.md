# Introduction

<div style="text-align: justify">
The [Visualization and Dissemination Module (VDM)](https://vdm.esa-worldcereal.org/) represents the gateway to access the WorldCereal processing system and the global products generated by the consortium. 

## Visualization of official WorldCereal products

Through the VDM, we provide the user with the ability to visualize and explore the [global products for 2021](https://esa-worldcereal.org/en/products/global-maps), generated at the end of the first phase of the project (2023).

Users have the possibility to explore individual products, generated per [agro-ecological zone](), or consult the merged products at global scale.

[Discover here](./visualize.md) the different viewing capabilities of the module.

## WorldCereal Processing Hub

Through the VDM, users can also conveniently access the [WorldCereal Processing Hub](https://hub.esa-worldcereal.org).

This application allows you to launch, monitor and download the result of WorldCereal processing jobs on the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE).

We currently support two types of processes:

- Download an official WorldCereal product for your area of interest
- Generate a customized cropland product for your area and season of interest

[Discover here](./launch.md) how to navigate this web-based application.

# Planned features

<div style="text-align: justify">
We will gradually be adding more processing services to the Processing Hub, e.g. to generate custom crop type products.
