Accurate estimates on cropped area, crop type distributions and irrigation practices play an important role in guiding policy decisions related to food & water security. In 2023, the WorldCereal consortium released the first set of high-resolution, global and season-specific [cropland, crop type and irrigation maps](https://esa-worldcereal.org/en/products/global-maps) for the year 2021, thereby demonstrating both the scientific and technical feasibility of such a challenging undertaking.

_WorldCereal 2021 temporary crop extent map, resampled to ~0.004 Â° resolution. Each pixel contains a number between 0 and 100, indicating the fractional cover of temporary crops within that pixel._


Based on the success of this first phase of the project, the consortium now continues to open up the processing system to the world, powered by the [Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/) and [OpenEO](https://openeo.org/).
