# How to use the cloud-based processing module?

<div style="text-align: justify">
Currently the Processing Module can be accessed through a series of Jupyter Notebooks, hosted on our public GitHub Repository. 

A user has the choice to run these notebooks:<br>
- on VITO's Terrascope platform, where everything you need is pre-installed for you<br>
- locally on your own system, after installing the worldcereal-classificaiton repository and associated Python environment<br>

Detailed instructions on how to get started, can be found in this [README](https://github.com/WorldCereal/worldcereal-classification/blob/main/README.md) file.
