## Extractions cache

### First level cache

The first level cache is a collection of netCDF raster files, all with a fixed size of e.g. 64x64 pixels.

#### First level cache requirements

1. netCDF assets need to link back to the sample from which they were generated.
2. a 'Ground truth' asset contains the raster with ground truth info, meaning the croptype code.
3. Sentinel-2 asset at 10m resolution.
4. Sentinel-1 asset at 20m resolution.
5. AgERA5 asset

STAC extensions:
- projection (proj) provides detailed info on raster size and projection system
