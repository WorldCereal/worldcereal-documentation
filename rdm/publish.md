# Publishing Reference Data

## The concept

<div style="text-align: justify">

Throught the RDM, users can publish their uploaded reference data to make it available to others.<br>

Upon sharing, users can choose to convert their private dataset into:, we make a distinction between:<br>
- **A restricted dataset**: users decide to share their dataset only with the WorldCereal consortium, but NOT with the general public. This way, the consortium can use this dataset to improve their default cropland and crop type models for your area of interest!<br><br>

- **A fully open dataset**: users share their dataset with the entire community, meaning anybody can view, download and use this dataset in their crop mapping applications.<br><br>

WorldCereal supports the general movement towards data sharing and open science. Please check the below link to learn more about WorldCerealâ€™s view on opening reference data to society ([https://esa-worldcereal.org/en/situ-data-global-crop-mapping](https://esa-worldcereal.org/en/situ-data-global-crop-mapping)).

## Practical implications

<div style="text-align: justify">

Before an uploaded dataset can be published, it undergoes thorough checks by a WorldCereal data moderator.<br>

The moderator:<br>
- checks whether all required metadata has been completed<br>
- computes and assigns a confidence score to the entire dataset based on a quality assessment accounting for spatial, temporal and thematic accuracy<br>

Confidence scores are computed based on a pre-defined protocol, depending on the type of the dataset. This protocol can be consulted here: [Confidence score calculations](https://rdm.esa-worldcereal.org/details/WorldCereal_ConfidenceScoreCalculations_v1_1.pdf)

## Workflow is Under Development!

<div style="text-align: justify">

We are currently working on a guided workflow within the RDM to facilitate data publication.<br>
In the meantime, if you would like to share your data with the consortium or public, please get in touch through ewoc-rdm@iiasa.ac.at<br>
