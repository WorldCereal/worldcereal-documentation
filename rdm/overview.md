# Reference Data Module

Availability of high-quality in-situ reference data remains one of the few bottlenecks for training and validating accurate cropland/crop type classification models. The WorldCereal Reference Data Module (RDM) is an online application that hosts a global collection of harmonized and curated in-situ reference datasets on land cover and crop type, freely accessible to anyone.   

The RDM hosts datasets from various providers with standardized metadata and attributes mapped to a unified crop type legend. Built-in automated data quality checks and careful curation performed by WorldCereal data moderators ensure high and transparent data quality. Through the RDM, users can view, query, download, contribute and share in-situ reference data.  

All this functionality is available through an intuitive user interface and a more advanced API service. The Reference Data Module is linked to the WorldCereal classification system through means of a STAC catalogue, which is queried automatically during classification model training. Through this initiative the WorldCereal consortium aims to foster open data sharing within the agricultural monitoring community.
