The [WorldCereal project](https://esa-worldcereal.org/en) aims to offer a processing system allowing anyone to train and apply custom cropland and/or crop type detection models using open Earth Observation (EO) data. 

This documentation portal aims to provide:

-	Relevant background information about the design of the system and implemented workflows
-	Practical and step-by-step guidelines on how to use the processing system

In the INTRODUCTION section, we provide insights into the origin and scope of the system, as well as an overview of the functionalities of the different system components. The other sections are each devoted to a different system component, containing both conceptual and practical information required to get you started.

Any remaining questions? Reach out to us through our dedicated [USER FORUM](https://forum.esa-worldcereal.org/)!


The WorldCereal project is executed by a consortium of six partners, lead by [VITO Remote Sensing](https://remotesensing.vito.be/):

and funded by the European Space Agency (ESA)
