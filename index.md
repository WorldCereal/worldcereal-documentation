# ESA WorldCereal documentation portal

This portal documents the design of the WorldCereal system.

Code samples in this portal are meant to document the design, but in general are not working. 
As openEO code is relatively concise, they serve as workflow descriptions and to render workflow diagrams in the form of
openEO process graphs.
